# Interactive-Robo-Twin
A real-time intelligent robotic mimicry system with integrated physics and gesture-based interaction.

Features:

Live Gesture Tracking: Powered by MediaPipe for zero-latency hand landmarking.

Physics Engine: Real-time gravity, collision detection, and momentum-based throwing.

Digital Twin: A simulated robotic hand interface that mirrors human DOF (Degrees of Freedom).

Interaction Layer: Spatial awareness logic for "grabbing" and "manipulating" virtual objects.
