# Interactive-Robo-Twin
A real-time intelligent robotic mimicry system with integrated physics and gesture-based interaction.

Features:
Live Gesture Tracking: Powered by MediaPipe for zero-latency hand landmarking.

Physics Engine: Real-time gravity, collision detection, and momentum-based throwing.

Digital Twin: A simulated robotic hand interface that mirrors human DOF (Degrees of Freedom).

Interaction Layer: Spatial awareness logic for "grabbing" and "manipulating" virtual objects.

How to Use
Mimicry: Wave your hand to see the robotic twin follow your movement.

Grab: Bring your thumb and index finger together over the Red Dot.

Throw: Move your hand quickly and release the pinch to toss the dot.

Physics: Watch the dot bounce and settle based on gravity.
